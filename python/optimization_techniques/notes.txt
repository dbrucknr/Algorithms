Three Rules of optimization (business logic / perspective):

1. Don't - You should always have measurable peformance goals before optimizing code.
2. Dont...Yet - Developer time is expensive; sometimes the best solution is to upgrade hardware.
3. Profile before optimizing - profiling measures where code spends its time.


General tips for optimizing

1. Use real data (don't use generated / synthetic data.) and benchmark on production hardware.
2. Windows: turn off anti-virus
3. Have a test suite ready
4. Know when to measure. Many programs have a warm-up time (config / database fetching).
