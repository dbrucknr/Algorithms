Design Patterns are typically split into three categories (Gamma Categorization)

1. Creational 
- Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
- Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (Dependency Injection, Reflection, etc)

2. Structural
- Concerned with the structure (class members) of classes / modules involved.
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface (Adherence to interfaces, etc)
- Stress the importance of good API design

3. Behavioral
- There is no central theme, each is different
