# The Big Omega Notation
-  Describes the limiting behavior of a function(i.e. run time (f) in terms of the input size(n)), when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
- Two distinct definitions
	-  **According to number theory**: it means that an f(n) function is not dominated by a g(n) function asymptotically.
	-  **According to complexity theory***:Â it means that an f(n) function is bounded below by an g(n) function asymptotically
-  It is like saying x > 10, then it is also true that x > 1
- This is the opposite of Big Ordo (Upper-Boundless or equal), here it is greater or equal, the lower bound
