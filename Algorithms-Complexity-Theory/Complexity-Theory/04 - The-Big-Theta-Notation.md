# The Big Theta Notation
- Describes the limiting behavior of a function(i.e. run time (f) in terms of the input size (n)), when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
- **The f(n) function is both Ordo and Omega at the same time.**
- The f(n) function will be in between the bounds c1 * g(n) - upper and the c2 * g(n) - lower.
	- Two bounds, an upper and lower - in between a range
- Big Theta is desirable (most of the time), what we are after
- Not going to be faster or slower than N^2
