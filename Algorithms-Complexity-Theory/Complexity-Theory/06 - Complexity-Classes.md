# Complexity Classes

### P (Polynomial) - easy problems
- All the decision problems can be solved with deterministic Turing-machines using a polynomial amount of computational time.
- These problems are efficiently solvable, but not all of these problems have practical solutions. 
- Example: bubble-sort is in (P), but we usually use merge sort for sorting problems.

### NP (Non-Deterministic Polynomial) - slightly harder
- If we have a certain solution for the problem, we can verify the solution in polynomial time.
- P is in NP Class

### NP Complete - very hard problems

### NP Hard - very, very hard
